# Projectile Arc

This is a collection of scripts for Unity that is tailored for creating arcs of things.
Its initial purpose was to shoot many projectiles, but it's general enough
that it could be used for about anything.

At its core is the ProjectileArc.cs script. This is what leverages the custom
editor. You should read the docs within the scripts themselves for more info.
